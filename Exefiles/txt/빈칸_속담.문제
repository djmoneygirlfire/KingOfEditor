To have lived is not enough
He who hesitates is lost
Heaven helps those who help themselves
A bad workman blames his tool
One rotten apple spoils the barrel
Don't bite off more than you can chew
I think, therefore I am
Four hands are better than two
The morning hour has gold in its mouth
Use it or lose it
all work and no play
a picture is worth a thousand words
Eat the frogs
mistakes are the best teachers
Your actions speak louder than your words
Blood is thicker than water
the exception makes the rule.
