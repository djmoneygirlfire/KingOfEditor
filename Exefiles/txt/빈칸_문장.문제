	How can you be different from everyone else and open a fresh market with a new product?
		The key to living a healthier, happier life is to eat the right foods.
		"Heritage" is what we have received from the past, what we live with today, and what we will pass on to future generations.
		Abu Simbel is a set of two massive rock temples in southern Egypt.
		The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983, is considered "the jewel of Muslim art in India."
		The ruins of Delphi are an important archaeological site in Greece.
		Iguazu National Park is located on the northern border of Argentina.
		Pamukkale, meaning Cotton Castle, is one of the most extraordinary natural wonders in Turkey.
		In June 2007, Jeju Island became South Koreas first natural heritage site to be added to the World Heritage List.
		Protecting and rescuing world heritage sites are urgent tasks that require everyone's help and cooperation.
		Indeed, our world heritage sites are not just a legacy that has been left to us by our ancestors, but also a precious treasure that we must pass on to our own children and their children.
		I found that snowflakes are miracles of beauty, and I felt sad that this beauty should not be seen and appreciated by others.
		Here's the story of a man who spent his entire life observing and photographing snowflakes.
		Looking at snow crystals through his microscope, he was amazed at their delicate beauty, complexity, and variety.
		Finally, after two years of painstaking trial and error, he became the first person in the world to photograph individual snowflakes.
		But Bentley was not discouraged, and he went on to capture over 6,000 snowflakes on film during his lifetime.
		His special interest in snow grew into a scientific curiosity about the development and shapes of snow crystals.
		Ironically, he died of pneumonia that same year, after walking home through a snowstorm.
		He will be always remembered as "the Snowflake Man."
		Emma has always been interested in Korea, so she is really excited about her first trip here.
		I knew that Korea was big in semiconductors, but it seems to be leading the way in next-generation IT, too.
		A big reason for this progress is that digital electronics such as cell phones and digital cameras have been must-have items for millions of Koreans for years now.
		We are a nation with a rich history, tradition, and culture of more than 5,000 years.
		So it's not an exaggeration to say that a Korean Wave is sweeping through Asia.
		I thought to myself, 'This must be the same force that is driving the Korean economy.'
		The goal of sustainable development is to balance the needs of people with the protection of nature.
		Generally, the bigger the windows are, the greener the building is.
		The sun can supply natural heat as well as light.
		Students at the Calhoun School in New York City have much more than a roof over their heads.
		With this in mind, green buildings use as little fresh water as possible, and they usually reuse water as well.
		Clearly, the more people use bamboo in buildings, the better our chances of saving the world¡¯s forests are.
		Many other parts of buildings can be made of recycled materials.
		Slowly but surely, the buildings where we study, sleep, and work are becoming healthier and greener.
		Some people consider thumbs to be a symbol of strength and superiority.
		The movement of the thumb underlies all the skilled procedures of which the hand is capable.
		It is a major food source for more than half of the world's population and is an important part of many cultures in the world.
		the people in New Zealand want to preserve the environment for future generations.
		People show a greater desire for an object when they learn that it is unique
		Prior experience colors perception.
		Human beings somehow seem naturally inclined to see life in contrasting pairs.
		The question of tax equality is a major concern for many people in underdeveloped countries.
		we can cognitively redefine our experiences by ridding ourselves of the prejudice we have against work.
		the appropriate decision on one¡¯s job itself will ensure a comfortable future, and soon success will be yours.
		you should be taking pictures of them at least a couple of times a month while they¡¯re young.
		Studies have shown that time spent in nature does us good.
		gratitude is one of the easiest of all principles in life to apply.
		So acupuncture¡¯s effect as a painkiller was finally pinned down.
		So get involved in the activities that are most meaningful to you, and make sure you don¡¯t overextend yourself.
		spending your vacation on such an amazing ship would surely be a memorable experience.
		A growing number of European supermarkets are using the colors of traffic lights to help consumers make healthy choices.
		Perhaps the best way for young children to use computers is to use  them only for a short time each day.
		Fertilizers that contain nitrogen have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems.
		But other groups of scientists think that even if the tipping point has been and gone there might still be hope
		Ostentation can be a credible boast of quality.
		It is no wonder, therefore, that science did not advance during the Roman Empire.
		Reaching beyond realism, the naturalists tried to illustrate as faithfully as possible whatever was observable to them within their literary works.
		If there is to be toleration in the world, one of the things taught in schools must be the habit of weighing evidence, and the practice of not giving full consent to propositions which there is no reason to believe true.
		Melanin is the body¡¯s first line of defense against these afflictions.
		America, as a society, has so mishandled the emotional lives of boys that it has produced many distant and troubled men.
		After millions of years of experience on earth, we have acquired the power to affect our planet¡¯s climate.
		Similarly, human societies in contact affect each other¡¯s development.
		When an emotion occurs, however, our mental spotlight suddenly contracts, focusing on one small thought to the exclusion of all others.
		But it is possible to acquire through long experience some appreciation of the point of view of the laboratory scientist, some understanding of his methods and the way he conceives a problem.
		And the memories of trips can last a lifetime, whereas material goods will wear out in a few years.
		Thus, for Confucius, the family, with its brotherly and sisterly love and respect for parents, was the most important thing of all.
		For the city, the opinion of the majority was equated with the truth.
		A major obstacle to discovery is not ignorance but knowledge.
		The ¡°mechanical¡± quality of life that industrialization promoted was proving to be a source of dissatisfaction for many, which made it ripe for its satirization by Charlie Chaplin in his 1936 film Modern Times.
		What time of the day is best for exercise?
		The reason nature is so wasteful is that scattershot strategies for reproduction are the best way to do what mathematicians call ¡°fully exploring the potential space.¡±
		accepting the brutal truths about their current conditions, they never lost hope that all would work out well in the end.
		A little conscious breathing would have enabled him to feel better about himself and allowed him to be more calm and clear.
		But what is interesting is that in this case the artist was very anxious to get the right proportions.
		Mona Lisa's aura is by no means an illusion, though there is something sadly ironic about visitors' trying to capture her with their own mechanical reproductions.
